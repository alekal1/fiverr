A leading agenda of [EECRG](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG#) is to put research into action through five research themes: Integrated Water Resources
Management for Agriculture, Sustainable Smallholder Land and Water Management, Sustainable Groundwater
Management, Water Resource Institutions and Policies, and Water, Health, and Environment.

  **Research**   

Based on a global model of supply and demand for food and water, this report shows that if current
water policies continue, farmers will indeed find it difficult to meet the world’s food needs. Hardest hit
will be the world’s poorest people. The results from the model used in this report also show the consequences of changing the course of water policy. Further inattention to water-related investments and
policies will produce a severe water crisis, which will lead in turn to a food crisis. A commitment to
sustainable use of water, through appropriate policies and investments, however, will lead to a more
water- and food-secure world. Water may be a scarce resource, but humans have developed many ways
of using it more efficiently—that is, getting more from each unit of water. But water-saving policies,
practices, and technologies are of no help if they are not used. Inappropriate incentives and institutions
often hinder effective use of water. This report spells out the future results of our current choices.

 **Updates**   

We will be adding statistics and all future reports to this data set on a weekly basis; EECRG will not be creating any new data sets. The data sample provided is simply the contents of our 26 page report. Since we are a not-for-profit we want to fully disclose that after 90 days we would like to remove 5% of our investment monthly to aid in further research and help spread awareness.

This dataset of about 13.800 rows lists the persons ""non-grata"" that are under financial sanctions of the European Union (EU) due to international and EU law. This is all about the who is who of people and institutions that face sanctions by the European Union and other nations. Enjoy the read.

# Who might use the data:

This data is important if you want to know with who a company, institution and/or person should be careful when it comes to business or financial exchanges/realations.

In its policy, the European Union intervenes when necessary to prevent conflict or in response to emerging or actual crises. In certain cases, EU intervention can take the form of restrictive measures or 'sanctions'. The application of financial sanctions and more precisely the freezing of assets constitutes an obligation for both the public and private sector. In this regard, a particular responsibility falls on credit and financial institutions, since they are involved in the bulk of financial transfers.

In order to facilitate the application of financial sanctions, the European Banking Federation, the European Savings Banks Group, the European Association of Co-operative Banks, the European Association of Public Banks (""the EU Credit Sector Federations"") and the European Commission recognized the need for an EU consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to financial sanctions and more precisely the freezing of assets. The Credit Sector Federations set up an initial database containing the consolidated list. 

The European Commission subsequently took over this database and is responsible for its maintenance and for keeping the consolidated list of sanctions up-to-date. In this respect, the Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) of the European Commission launched a new Web page in June 2017, where the consolidated lists of financial sanctions consisting in freezing of assets are published in different formats (see link below).

Value has been added by rearranging the file a bit, but there is no real compute to data option for this set.

Germany is one of the leading markets when it comes to transition to renewable energies and the home of approx 80 Million people and some of  leading industries in Europa and worldwide. 

The dataset contains all the necessary information on realised power generation (for each individual type of primary energy source, see below in the data description) and power consumption in Germany (see below). 

To put this into market and price context I added hourly price information for the power exchange with the relevant neighbor countries Luxembourg, Denmark, France, Sweden, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria in EUR / MWh. 

To get the full picture on the energy market between 2015 and 2020 I further included the hourly exports and imports of power with the neighbor countries Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Sweden, Austria, France and Poland in MWh.

The dataset is provided as CSV file to allow machine readability and of course I provided a sample to get a view on the syntax and information provided. The full download contains about 50 MB of raw data to compute and analyze.

## Use cases and applications:

The energy sector is under constant development. Dynamic energy management is the most innovative approach to managing the load. Smart energy management systems have developed abilities to combine smart end-use devices, distributed energy resources, and advanced control and communication. Big data analytics, machine learning and AI play a leading part here as they drive dynamic management systems in Smart Grids. This enables the optimization of the energy flows, production and coordination between providers and consumers as well as international trading and power storage. The efficiency of the energy management system, in its turn, depends on the load forecasting and renewable energy sources.

This dataset enables AI and machine learning algorithms to learn about the dynamics of one of the largest energy markets in Europa to predict and control advanced control systems, and integrated communication architecture. Dynamic energy management systems process vast quantities of data attained by practical methods and solutions. Applying big data analytics to this data helps to make performance estimation and provide smart recommendations for energy management.

This data might also be used to analyize the transition and changes in energy markets while controlling for price and other market dynamics to isolate net effects.

## Small Disclaimer:

You might try to argue that this information is obtainable through other sources and might not be unique, but this is not what this is all about. This market is about added value, access to valuable data and about information and about pricing of valuable information and data. You might spend a lot of time and money to acquire and prepare this information yourself. This data has been collected, translated and aggregated to add as much value as possible and to drive new applications in business analytics, research, machine learning and AI.

The CO2 mapping follows the principles for using the CO2 calculator developed by COWI and DCE (NERI) for the Ministry of Climate and KL in 2008. However, in some cases more specific calculations are assumed than those that can be predicted with the CO2 calculator. This is because the emission factors in the CO2 calculator, despite continuous updating, do not contain the latest data.

The survey includes the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), so that CO2 equivalents and not just CO2 emissions are calculated. The change means that the CO2 accounts thereby become more precise and fair. This applies to the calculation of CO2 emissions from electricity consumption, district heating and individual heating for households.

These data sets are publicly available via Opendata.dk
Value has been added by translating from Danish to English.

This data token will include access to data sets from 2013-2018, and as new data sets on CO2 accounting in Copenhagen are published they will be added.

It represents a departure from the usual physical examination teaching tools which, in their attempts to be all
inclusive, tend to de-emphasize the practical nature of patient care. As a result, students frequently have difficulty identifying what information is
truly relevant, why it's important & how it applies to the actual patient. By approaching clinical surgery in a pragmatic & demystified fashion, the
significance of the material should be readily apparent & the underlying principles more clearly understood.  

Format of this book
 Topics of the modules are carefully selected according the needs of undergraduate surgical students & postgraduate general surgery
trainees.
 In particular each module is written to answer the question: ""What do I really need to know about this area of patient disease?"" The material covered is presented in a concise, ordered fashion that should be readily
applicable to the common clinical scenarios that you will actually see in day to day practice.  
 Important & relevant points in history taking are given in each module with an emphasis to formulate a working diagnosis before clinical
examination.
 Clinical examination techniques are described in step-by-step detail, with aids of photographs. 
 Special maneuvers that are frequently utilized or asked in viva examination are also described. 
 The rationale for each aspect of the examination is addressed &, where appropriate, relevant pathophysiology discussed.  
 In general, students identify their role in patient care either by trial & error, or through the beneficence of more senior students, residents or consultants. This is not particularly efficient & diminishes the
potential for learning & fun.  
 Colored photographs, as well as illustrations, clearly identifying appropriate clinical techniques are given including a lot of gross
clinical photographs. 

I hope that this book helps you to master the art of history taking & clinical examination, both for the benefit of your patients & for your excellence in the profession. As the skills required of a surgeon/physician cannot be learned from any single source, I encourage you to make use of as many other references as possible. This should reinforce basic principles & alert you to the fact that there are often many ways of achieving the same end (ie there is frequently no single right way
of doing something). What follows, then, serves merely as an introduction. I have tried to capture those core behaviors that define clinical excellence & will have prolonged applicability, even in a
technology driven world. The learning process continues (I hope) until the day you stop practicing medicine. There are always new techniques to learn & unusual findings to incorporate into your personal libraries of medical experience. However, unless you take the time to build a solid foundation, you will never have confidence in the accuracy & value of what you can uncover with a sharp mind, agile fingers & a few simple tools!

Suggestions
Any suggestion for the improvement of this book will be acknowledged with thanks.

Before I go through with the rest of the description of this Data, please read these few pointers first:

 1. All Links and data have been checked for Copyright. i.e. Usually OnlyFans profiles have a Copyright note in their bio. If the user had such or anything relating to them owning all rights and refusing distribution of the data, such data has been and will be removed from this Data. 
 2. This is a project that's here to stay, the only reason it has a liquidity pool is for discovery. Please **DO NOT** add liquidity for your own profits since this will prevent users from buying the data. ***HOWEVER if the liquidity increases and the price gets absurdly high, I will replace the files in the Drive linked in samples will the FULL data so everyone can benefit.*** 
 3. This Dataset contains over 1TB of Content, and more will be kept adding every single day, possibly every few hours. The goal is to keep this data flowing .

## What's inside? 
> Ohh boy...good question.
> 
 Over 1TB of Mega and other drive links to OnlyFans, Private snapchats, Private Kiks and more content and other user data, including premium paid content. 
 
 ## BUT OH THIS IS AVAILABLE FOR FREE...
 ...mhhh yeah and no. most of this is VIP files from many forums that I paid for to get access to. 
 And then compiled it into a good presented link for others, filtered out all the copyright and non-distributable content

They build them, are famous for them and deeply love them. Lets analyze the preferences of German individuals and companies when it comes to automobiles, trucks and trailers (utility vehicles) in detail.

This dataset of more than 660.000 data points contains detailed aggregated registration information for the German market for more than 47 million automobiles and more than 5.5 million utility vehicles from over 100 different manufactures over the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. It features data for each individual combination of manufacturer / brand, trading name of the individual vehicles, type key number, power, fuel type, type of vehicle body, overall number of registered vehicles of this type, number of registrations for private individuals, number of vehicle owners aged 29 or less, vehicle owners aged 60 or more and the number of number of female owners.

This dataset is highly valuable to keep track of the market, predict changing customer preferences, target audiences for campaigns and market shares based on changing distributions of registrations over time. 

Data is provided as CSV file to allow machine readability and a sample is provided to validate content and structure of data for further usage. The full dataset contains about 4 MB of data to compute and analyze.

## Disclaimer and a few words on the current state of the (beta) market:

1. Some argue that this information is obtainable through other sources and might not be unique, but this is not what this is all about. This market is about added value, access to valuable data, the pricing of valuable information and market exploration in ways that where not possible before. You might spend a lot of time and money to acquire and prepare this information yourself, if you are capable of doing it. This data has been found, prepared, translated and aggregated to add as much value as possible and to drive new applications. 

2. Stake responsibly and be aware that you are setting the price for the asset through the dynamic pricing mechanism. If you want to speculate on this asset, you might chose to do so on your own risk and after doing your own research. Be aware that this might negatively affect the chance of someone buying this asset by driving prices too high. Part of this  minimizes potential revenue of sales and thus staking rewards based on sales. Preparing this data is work and I will of course take partial profits from the dataset to cover for work, gas fees and cover risks involved in this highly volatile beta market. Thanks for your patience and understanding.

3. I only provide valuable information with added value without copyright infringements or violations of property rights. If you like my work and want to support it, you can find my community reputation profile here:

The pdf will contain  text describing how to pump and dump the ocean market for gains.

I've used this technique since the market's inception and it's brought me lots of gains.

Since everyone is here for gains anyway there might as well be a text describing how to do it the right way.

This dataset features the yearly amount of all goods categories flowing through the Kiel-Canal or ""Nord-Ostsee-Kanal"" / ""North-Baltic Sea canal"" which is the world’s busiest man-made water-way navigable by seagoing ships. It is used by a similar number of ships as on the Panama and Suez Canals together. The canal links the North Sea to the Baltic Sea and pro-vides a direct link for the North Sea ports to the Baltic Sea region. For the seaports of Hamburg, Bremen, Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven, in particular, the Kiel Canal is an indispensable transit route enabling them to operate efficiently. The time and distance ad-vantages (a saving of 460 km) offered by the Kiel Canal provide shipping with a competitive edge. 

The relevant costal countries here are all the states located at the Baltic Sea, namely Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Sweden.

This data could be used as an indicator for commercial activity in the region and/or to forecast future activity and to analyze shipping routes.

Value has been added by translation, aggregation and by providing metadata for the datamarket. It is machine readable and can be used for machine learning and AI interaction / automatic data processing.

A widely deployed model to understand technology builds on the concept of the technology life cycle. This life cycle from basic research to market development and commercial diffusion is bridged by patents. Patents bridge the gap between research and markets. 
Patents play a very prominent role in the technology life cycle and allow competitive technologies to be protected and licensed to third parties to expand financial opportunities. 

This dataset is a combination of various sets of data and lists the top 50 companies for each year between 2016 and 2019 when it comes to patent applications in Germany.

To put this into geographic context the overall number of patents in each federal state for the years 2016 to 2019 have been added to show federal states that foster innovation and research and are the most active environments for innovation.

## Use cases and applications:

When it comes to investments or stock markets the numbers provide valuable information to evaluate decisions based on facts and contribute to the forecasting of innovation and further market developments and evaluations. Those with a high number of patents in Germany have a competitive edge in the German market of the future when the technological life cycle ends in market diffusion and commercial application. 

This is especially true since Germany is know for strict enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR).

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Content
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Inspiration

High-quality financial data is expensive to acquire and is therefore rarely shared for free. Here I provide the full historical daily price and volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT. It's one of the best datasets of its kind you can obtain.

Content
The data (last updated 11/10/2017) is presented in CSV format as follows: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt. Note that prices have been adjusted for dividends and splits.

## Profile: OpenData

In my opinion the OCEAN based data market is nothing less then a revolution and the future of liberation for data. My aim is to contribute to the long term success of this marketplace, offer interesting and useful data, add value and sometimes a bit of fun (jokes might be little hidden sometimes) and see towards growing it into the future of datamarkets together with the rest of the OCEAN navy and contributors.

**About:**

_Acholeplasma laidlawii are small bacteria which lack a cell wall. Like other Acholeplasma and Mycoplasma, A laidlawii has been identified as a common contaminant of growth media for cell culture._

_The genome of A. laidlawii is represented by a single 1,496,992-bp circular chromosome with an average G+C content of 31 mol%. This is the longest genome among the Mollicutes with a known nucleotide sequence. It contains genes of polymerase type I, SOS response, and signal transduction systems, as well as RNA regulatory elements, riboswitches, and T boxes._

**Data Publisher Transparency Note:**
 
Data publisher is locked into a long-term stake. Temporary liquidity withdrawals will only be used to fund the acquisition and publishing of future data sets. 

For transparency, the community will now be notified via community chat and twitter prior to such withdrawals to avoid damaging reputation of said data set, and to help build a sustainable culture within the ocean market place for the support of valued research data. 
(LP withdraw will be capped to no greater then to 5 to 10% if ever needed to acquire new data for the market place).

  A curated vault of gif's.

I am excited to be participating in this new Ocean Protocol data marketplace in the beta version. This is a simple test for educational purposes only. No LP will be withdrawn as I do not want to get in trouble(this is not a commercial venture, in fact it costs me $$$ to do this). All material contained in this vault is freely available online, and collected and curated by myself over time. The vault will be added to regularly if there seems to be interest in this test project. Any questions, comments, or suggestions are to be forwarded to goblinsandtrolls247@gmail.com

If you have any gifs you would like to contribute, please email whatever you would like to the listed email address as well(I will still be acting as curator). There is a 15 gig limit to the google drive, but if there is enough interest in a curated gif data base, I will keep working on it, and updating, dividing into folders, and expanding storage if need be(I would need interest and suggestions to warrant spending any real time on this aspect). The right is reserved to delete anything in the drive at any time, as well as to stop uploading to the drive. This is just a test, and I plan to follow through and see where it goes, but I also don't want to be married to a full time volunteer gif curating job for life either. 

The gif database contains 2.4 gigs of gifs at the time of this dataset being published.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  

This is V4, first version didn’t work, and V2 and V3 didn’t either. Took some workarounds for a couple days to figure it out. I am hoping it works this time. The reason for this test is that I wanted to create something that people might actually try to use, as opposed to simply providing liquidity, because for a proper beta test, we need to be using data, as well as pooling, etc, and pushing the boundaries for this beta test phase so the kinks get ironed out for when more functionality begins to come online.  

I will keep my promise(from each version) and not pull out liquidity in original gif vaults, until everyone else pulls theirs, so please pull your liquidity, so we can all get our value back for failed tests(minus tx fees, I apologize).

WILL NOT PULL LIQUIDITY ON ORIGINAL GIF VAULT UNTIL I OWN 100% OF LP - (This goes for original GIF VAULT as well as V2 and V3).

 For this one(V4), I will not be pulling liquidity, ever, unless project kinda dies off, and again, I won’t pull LP until I own 100%(or very near close to it, and I will give ample announcements if I do decide to shut it down - announcements to be found in ocean farming telegram channel - https://t.me/Farm_Ocean - always check the pinned message first). I’m hoping to have something up in the market that isn’t completely useless or easy to find in one place(like many data sets right now that are just taken from elsewhere as is, without being processed, while being freely available). Something people might want to actually use. People like gif’s, right? So…. Have fun out there. Lets see where we can push the boundaries of Ocean Marketplace!!!!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  

If you download the dataset, and it gives a password error, simply refresh and retry.  If you want to publish a dataset, make sure you go here to get the correct address, or you will waste a lot of $$$ like I did(ocean marketplace needs a direct download link, and not a link to a preview that google gives you).  

https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/home 

 If you use the links that google gives you, the sample will work, but the main downloadable database won’t work…. You will just be giving people a wall of code(in html) that will be worthless to anyone.


 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  

A final note(V2): I couldn’t link directly to a folder in the link uploaded for the data set(sample was just one gif as opposed to folder of gifs in test, and main database got scrambled by algorithm and pumped out wall of code). The work around I figured out is to make a pdf, upload that to a google drive, and the pdf contains a link and a password that goes to a password protected rerouter, through tiny url, and then onto the google drive database folder. I'm now using a .xslx file extension instead of a .pdf, but I think both will work with the new direct download link method. If you want to know where to find the tool I used for your own password protected rerouting solution, the one I used is here:

https://jstrieb.github.io/link-lock/create/

I’m not a dev so please excuse my archaic methods to try and make this work.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  

Special thank goes out to @SAMER for helping solve a simple technical issue for me. I will be writing an article about my experiences during this educational experience, so hopefully these tests don’t go to waste. Education is very valuable, and we all pay for it, one way or another…My preference is the cost of time, so hopefully I can pass the savings on to others’. 

 If this last version doesn’t work, I will announce it, and try getting everyone to remove liquidity from all pools and I will bow out with a valiant effort, and an empty pocket(once I own 100% lp in each pool), and let the experts deal with it. If it does work, V4 will stay up for the foreseeable future, and I will have no intention of taking it down or pulling LP…. If there is interest, I will continue to update with more .gif's and listen to suggestions(the sky is the limit, please, let me know, I would love for this to be utilized). So please, if you like this idea, email the email listed in the first paragraph( goblinsandtrolls247@gmail.com ), and send in your gifs and suggestions, and lets make this a fun collective community effort!

Code Requirements

\- Opencv(pip install opencv-python)\
\- Tkinter(Available in python)\
\- PIL (pip install Pillow)\
\- Pandas(pip install pandas)

What steps you have to follow??

\- Buy my Attendace Management System\
\- Create a TrainingImage folder in a project.\
\- Open a AMS_Run.py and change the all paths with your system path\
\- Run AMS_Run.py.

Project Structure

\- After run you need to give your face data to system so enter your ID and name in box than click on Take Images button.\
\- It will collect 200 images of your faces, it save a images in TrainingImage folder\
\- After that we need to train a model(for train a model click on Train Image button.\
\- It will take 5-10 minutes for training(for 10 person data).\
\- After training click on Automatic Attendance ,it can fill attendace by your face using our trained model (model will save in TrainingImageLabel )\
\- it will create .csv file of attendance according to time & subject.\
\- You can store data in database (install wampserver),change the DB name according to your in AMS_Run.py.\
\- Manually Fill Attendace Button in UI is for fill a manually attendance (without facce recognition),it's also create a .csv and store in a database.

Notes

\- It will require high processing power(I have 8 GB RAM & 2 GB GC)\
\- If you think it will recognise person just like humans,than leave it ,its not possible.\
\- Noisy image can reduce your accuracy so quality of images matter.", attendance-management-system attendance-management-system-opencv opencv attendance-system gui tkinter face-recognition attendance-using-face-recognition,unknown,text/html,https://github.com/Spidy20/Attendace_management_system/blob/master/AMS.gif,True,0x04b1e988c352813965385b0f5066f7468edea9b40e7ac0c1b76f47235b2442e1bced264fe40b9a9acd36bc88f9360efa0103e7b2551bbea7d596a12c28fd47bb151b30fb04f4f78ae25a0e6c233d950e2f5601e9b57901ab987f9ea755f5a6bbfec8ec3078317901e9b609568e7a5822b0f34e58348def49e09a55592de8d4b100b6ac5ad96751fda4739c938b7fa56d5873a46b2031b69996bc9abab6ee4bbd1433f118217cb65cabdcac7bfe12e855b9fd5c34bd4df4b6b883374274456ef948,0,0x2A1bE410439eb7866A8c0557416Aee8C99Eef84D,2020-11-05T15:21:25Z,2020-11-05T15:21:25Z,0x8E8faA2c14859C3EEbC7E7731C285D3D47bB5CE7,AddressHash,0x57b34eb7c4627cd91e12956221dad863f8c9c3e0c1ea3e9fb0d33d99d337d7b3,0x2A1bE410439eb7866A8c0557416Aee8C99Eef84D,Delighted Oyster Token,DELOYS-70,18,10.0,1000.0,0x8E8faA2c14859C3EEbC7E7731C285D3D47bB5CE7,0.0,2020-11-05T15:21:25Z,10.0,2828.939834119352,314.6412895250086,pool,0xE83516860e75DF6bb76b77132aD59c9Db9134c91,0xE83516860e75DF6bb76b77132aD59c9Db9134c91, 0xE83516860e75DF6bb76b77132aD59c9Db9134c91

Introduction: Hello I am rordy, active in the Ocean telegram community! This is my idea for reputation as it has multiple uses! I have a lot of ideas all the time, but I am still learning about data sets and AI so I haven't uploaded any yet and hope to contribute positively to the Ocean Ecosystem in the future. For my next upload to Ocean Market I will liquidate tokens from my pool to cover gas fees, but I promise not to RUG. I have added a sample picture of my editable Telegram handle for proof of Rordy and for the file I have added a Trent NFT I made so this token doubles as a Trent NFT :) Thank you & stake on my reputation if you like it!

I am excited to be participating in this new Ocean Protocol data marketplace in the beta version. This is a simple test for educational purposes only. No LP will be withdrawn as I do not want to get in trouble(this is not a commercial venture, in fact it costs me $$$ to do this). All material contained in this vault is freely available online, and collected and curated by myself over time. The vault will be added to regularly if there seems to be interest in this test project. Any questions, comments, or suggestions are to be forwarded to goblinsandtrolls247@gmail.com

If you have any gifs you would like to contribute, please email whatever you would like to the listed email address as well(I will still be acting as curator). There is a 15 gig limit to the google drive, but if there is enough interest in a curated gif data base, I will keep working on it, and updating, dividing into folders, and expanding storage if need be(I would need interest and suggestions to warrant spending any real time on this aspect). The right is reserved to delete anything in the drive at any time, as well as to stop uploading to the drive. This is just a test, and I plan to follow through and see where it goes, but I also don't want to be married to a full time volunteer gif curating job for life either. 
The gif database contains 2.4 gigs of gifs at the time of this dataset being published.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  This is V2, first version didn’t work. Took some workarounds for a couple days to figure it out. I am hoping it works this time. The reason for this test is that I wanted to create something that people might actually try to use, as opposed to simply providing liquidity, because for a proper beta test, we need to be using data, as well as pooling, etc, and pushing the boundaries for this beta test phase so the kinks get ironed out for when more functionality begins to come online.  I will keep my promise and not pull out liquidity in original gif vault, until everyone else pulls theirs, so please pull your liquidity, so we can all get out value back for a failed test. WILL NOT PULL LIQUIDITY ON ORIGINAL GIF VAULT UNTIL I OWN 100% OF LP. For this one(V2), if it does work(it should as I tested heavily in Rinkeby for almost 2 full days) I will not be pulling liquidity, ever, unless project kinda dies off, and again, I won’t pull LP until I own 100%. I’m hoping to have something up in the market that isn’t completely useless or easy to find in one place(like many data sets are just taken from elsewhere as is). Something people might want to actually use. So…. Have fun out there. Lets see where we can push the boundaries of Ocean Marketplace!!!!  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  A final note: I couldn’t link directly to a folder in the link uploaded for the data set(sample was just one gif as opposed to folder of gifs in test, and main database got scrambled by algorithm and pumped out wall of code). The work around I figured out is to make a pdf, upload that to a google drive, and the pdf contains a link and a password that goes to a password protected rerouter, through tiny url, and then onto the google drive database folder.

Dataset Description - 22 GB of Data
-----------------------

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 200,000 scholarly articles, including over 100,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. 

This dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.

Call to Action
-----------

We are issuing a call to action to the world's artificial intelligence experts to develop text and data mining tools that can help the medical community develop answers to high priority scientific questions. The CORD-19 dataset represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for data mining to date. 

This allows the worldwide AI research community the opportunity to apply text and data mining approaches to find answers to questions within, and connect insights across, this content in support of the ongoing COVID-19 response efforts worldwide. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid increase in coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical community to keep up.

 mobile operator. The dataset is generated from two mobility patterns (static and car), and across two application patterns
(video streaming and file download). The dataset is composed of
client-side cellular key performance indicators (KPIs) comprised of
channel-related metrics, context-related metrics, cell-related metrics and throughput information. These metrics are generated from
a well-known non-rooted Android network monitoring application, G-NetTrack Pro. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first publicly available dataset that contains throughput, channel
and context information for 5G networks. To supplement our realtime 5G production network dataset, we also provide a 5G large
scale multi-cell ns-3 simulation framework. The availability of the
5G/mmwave module for the ns-3 mmwave network simulator provides an opportunity to improve our understanding of the dynamic
reasoning for adaptive clients in 5G multi-cell wireless scenarios.
The purpose of our framework is to provide additional information
(such as competing metrics for users connected to the same cell),
thus providing otherwise unavailable information about the base
station (eNodeB or eNB) environment and scheduling principle,
to end user. Our framework permits other researchers to investigate this interaction through the generation of their own synthetic
datasets.

FRA (Fundamental Rights Agency) conducted an online survey to identify how lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people living in the European Union and Croatia experience the fulfilment of their fundamental rights. 

The survey was made available online, from April to July 2012, in all 23 official EU languages (except Irish) plus Catalan, Croatian, Luxembourgish, Russian and Turkish. In total, 93,079 LGBT persons completed the survey. FRA’s inhouse experts designed the survey which was implemented by Gallup, one of the market leaders in large-scale surveys. In addition, civil society organisations including ILGA-Europe (European Region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association) and Transgender Europe (TGEU) provided advice on how to best approach LGBT people.

To this end, we offer tools and support for scientists interested in documenting/advertising their dataset in the metadatabase, in submitting or publishing their primary biodiversity data (i.e. species occurrence records) or having their dataset linked to the Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal. This information portal serves as a data discovery tool, and allows scientists and managers to complement, integrate, and analyse distribution data to elucidate patterns in freshwater biodiversity. The Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal was initiated under the EU FP7 BioFresh project and continued through the Freshwater Information Platform (http://www.freshwaterplatform.eu). To ensure the broad availability of biodiversity data and integration in the global GBIF index, we strongly encourages scientists to submit any primary biodiversity data published in a scientific paper to national nodes of GBIF or to thematic initiatives such as the Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal.

Context

YouTube maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”.

Note that this dataset is a structurally improved version of this dataset.

Content

This dataset includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the IN, US, GB, DE, CA, FR, RU, BR, MX, KR, and JP regions (India, USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and, Japan respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.

Each region’s data is in a separate file. Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.

The data also includes a category_id field, which varies between regions. To retrieve the categories for a specific video, find it in the associated JSON. One such file is included for each of the 11 regions in the dataset.

For more information on specific columns in the dataset refer to the column metadata.

Acknowledgements

This dataset was collected using the YouTube API.
This dataset is the updated version of Trending YouTube Video Statistics.

This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015.

The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). 

Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.

This dataset is an SQLite database.

Many design considerations exist in this relatively new field where parallel processing frameworks can be employed in a more economical fashion. Unlike traditional data sources, Big Data applications present their own unique challenges in order to appropriately harness the utility of open source frameworks including Apache Spark and design patterns predicated on the Directed Acyclic Graph. By embracing this new paradigm, parallel processing can be effectively leveraged to support development at a level of scale and performance that was not possible earlier.

The wider research community is actively working on accurately predicting the percent population who are exposed, recovered, or have built immunity. Researchers currently build epidemiology models and simulators using available data from agencies and institutions, as well as historical data from similar diseases such as influenza, SARS, and MERS. It’s an uphill task for any model to accurately capture all the complexities of the real world. Challenges in building these models include learning parameters that influence variations in disease spread across multiple countries or populations, being able to combine various intervention strategies (such as school closures and stay-at-home orders), and running what-if scenarios by incorporating trends from diseases similar to COVID-19. COVID-19 remains a relatively unknown disease with no historic data to predict trends.


We are now open-sourcing a toolset for researchers and data scientists to better model and understand the progression of COVID-19 in a given community over time. This toolset is comprised of a disease progression simulator and several machine learning (ML) models to test the impact of various interventions.

### Data 

Burnwild is a smart contract, ready to be deployed. 

You will find :

. Truffle project with tests

.  Flattened Solidity file of the Smart Contract (to deploy using Remix)

-----

### Introduction 

Burnwild is a cyclic deflationary protocol with **2BURN** Tokens :

. The burn rate oscillates between 0.1% and 10%

. Initial supply : **10 000**

-----
### Burn rate oscillation

When the smart contract is deployed, the burn rate is 0.1%.
At every transfer, the burn rate is increasing. 

**In 100 transfers**, the burn
rate will reach 10%.

![burn rate chart](https://i.ibb.co/gghtHFZ/burnrate.png)

This phase where the burn rate is increasing is the ""BURN"" state.

When 10% is reached, the protocol is switching to the ""COLD"" state, and the
burn rate is decreasing from 10% to 0.1%.

-----

### Activate burn

Once the smart contract is deployed, the burn rate is not increasing, you must
activate the mechanism by calling this function :

```javascript
function activate() public onlyOwner returns (bool)
```
**Why ?** 
To avoid burning tokens when you add liquidity

-----

### Change oscillation speed

As the owner of the contract. You can call this function :

```javascript
function setStepLevel(uint256 stepLevel) public onlyOwner returns (bool)
```

The initial stepLevel is 1. It means that you have to make 100 transfers to
complete a state.
If the stepLevel = 2, you have to make 50 transfers, etc...

The stepLevel must validate this condition : 
```javascript
// Check if number is valid
function _isValidLevel(uint256 number) private returns (bool) {
    return (number > 0 ) && (number <= 100) && ((100 % number) == 0);
}
```

.  0 < stepLevel <= 100

. 100 **modulo** stepLevel == 0

-----

### Technical specifications

- Solidity version : 0.6.12
- OpenZeppelin
- Truffle

-----

### Run tests :

```
npm install truffle -g
npm install
truffle compile
truffle test
```

Weight, BMI, Body Fat, Fat Free Body Weight, Subcutaneous Fat, Visceral Fat, Body Water, Skeletal Muscle, Muscle Mass, Bone Mass, Protein, BMR and Metabolic Age										

The dataset also contains other relevant information like demographic, health data before and after ketogenic diet plan etc. The sample file shows some section of data including graph.

Use case:
The ketogenic diet is a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet mainly used for weight loss and to treat various medical conditions. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates by putting the body into ketosis. Ketogenic Diet is high in anti inflammatory foods.. Thus it helps in reducing inflammation in the body. 

This dataset can be used by researchers, medical professionals, nutritionist, fitness equipment and wearable companies like fitbit, apple watch etc to understand the effect of ketogenic diet on various health parameters. This dataset contains the personal health data of a person who had previous health conditions but improved after following ketogenic diet. The improved health parameters are included in the dataset.

Imagine if, instead of just seeing us as a walk-in customer, whose payment it either accepts or declines, a retailer could know other types of information about us: for example, whether we were visiting for the third time this week and spending more than normal; whether we were redeeming an offer and if we’d shared that offer with a friend; or if we were moving from A to B.

If we are buying online, internet retailers like Amazon already have a whole host of similar information about our purchasing habits. Rolph’s company extends the principle to high-street retailers, who have traditionally lacked any equivalent purchaser information.

Yoyo (partnered company) insists it does this on an anonymised basis: retailers can’t see our actual identities, merely a tokenised representation of the individuals who walk into their stores.

Customers paying with Yoyo’s digital wallet now represent over 15 percent of sales at Caffe Nero, says Yoyo, while its average share of checkout transaction volumes at high street stores ranges from 12.5 to 30 percent, depending on the retailer it is working with.

This dataset consists of over 8200 daily oberservations made by 6 bicycle traffic monitoring stations in Munich, State Capital of Bavaria, Germany. 

Munich is the capital and most populous city of Bavaria, the second most populous German state. With a population of over 1.5 million inhabitants as of July 31, 2020, it is the third-largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg. The city's metropolitan region is home to 6 million people.

The data in this dataset from January 2017 to September 2020 has been collected by six traffic monitoring stations in the city area that measure the flow in both directions. The data has been aggregated on a daily level but is separated for each individual monitoring station. Each monitoring station coordinates and address is included in the dataset to allow a location model via coordinates and/or address.


# Who might use the data:

This data could be used by mobility as a service providers, ridesharing providers and various other businesses to analyze and predict mobility behavior in large urban areas and to find an edge in behavioral analysis. This data can further be used in the AI based optimization of traffic and/or planning of large metropolitan areas in Europe and worldwide. Further applications could demand forecasting for new mobility solutions and overall effects on mobility over time in large cities.

To control for environmental variables that have an influence on mobility choice the daily data on minimum and maximum temperature, cloudiness and rainfall / precipitation levels are added to each measurement. This way the effects can be observed and eliminated in analysis and forecasting models to control for changes in behaviour over time, i.e. before, during and after the initial Covid-19 outbreak that struck Bavaria especially hard.

Value has been added by aggregation of over 30 datasets, translation and transformation of this dataset to allow for compute to data, forecasting and AI applications. This data is fully machine readable and provided as CSV file.

The dataset contains the latest available data on COVID-19 including a daily situation update, the epidemiological curve and the global geographical distribution (EU/EEA and the UK, worldwide).

On 12 February 2020, the novel coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while the disease associated with it is now referred to as COVID-19. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, ECDC’s Epidemic Intelligence team has been collecting on daily basis the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, based on reports from health authorities worldwide. To insure the accuracy and reliability of the data, this process is being constantly refined. This helps to monitor and interpret the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic not only in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), but also worldwide. Every day between 6.00 and 10.00 CET, a team of epidemiologists screens up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest figures. The data screening is followed by ECDC’s standard epidemic intelligence process for which every single data entry is validated and documented in an ECDC database. An extract of this database, complete with up-to-date figures and data visualisations, is then shared on the ECDC website, ensuring a maximum level of transparency.", covid pandemic data dataset covid19 health economy,unknown,unknown,unknown,True,0x047e738d4e5e2696f2fa16e681ee21a625a3417ca5f08b0745af590a75e40e253fe5b972df3c5480787b9d53f32823347c3abf045c6a1365d73fff6161b57ae381cfebed249d1de4f6fe7b85edfa8ddb1e0f54e4b8bfecd645f0dc179b41d81067a0a9fdadd39367bb5170f45248d40dd6d68d5b9f88cc4f6edb9cce54e6d9a0b9f89cb3d45a0dcc28500c7030299889c4244d4fd72083884cd648e4416f1cfe13ebb7c058e01b74651740aaf1b6,0,0x73aE4250a5185Ecc966cfCB46F447023398b0AE8,2020-10-29T18:18:31Z,2020-10-29T18:18:31Z,0xC24ffC2E5F31d586A8A2eD0487B41C1CDe060601,AddressHash,0x60b81b8e22e432105a579a01b64e58d623bc7b85a557866cce1be79de1988f85,0x73aE4250a5185Ecc966cfCB46F447023398b0AE8,Ambitious Plankton Token,AMBPLA-92,18,9.0,1000.0,0xC24ffC2E5F31d586A8A2eD0487B41C1CDe060601,7.572763322122039,2020-10-29T18:18:31Z,1.4272366778779606,38.19188461017806,0.0,pool,0x36fA544a4ed059598A627524cDCCB3F73f0a25ca,0x36fA544a4ed059598A627524cDCCB3F73f0a25ca, 0x36fA544a4ed059598A627524cDCCB3F73f0a25ca

Body language is an important aspect of human
communication, which an effective human-robot interaction interface should mimic well. Human beings exchange
information and convey their thoughts and feelings through
gaze, facial expressions, body language and tone of voice
along with spoken words, and infer 65% of the meaning
of the communicated messages from these nonverbal cues.
Modern robotic platforms are however limited in their
ability to automatically generate behaviours that align
with their speech. In this paper, we develop a neural
network based system that takes audio from a user as an
input and generates upper-body gestures including head,
hand and torso movements of the user on a humanoid
robot, namely, Softbank Robotics’ Pepper. Our system
was evaluated quantitatively as well as qualitatively using
web-surveys when driven by natural speech and synthetic
speech. We compare the impact of generic and personspecific neural network models on the quality of synthesised
movements. We further investigate the relationships between quantitative and qualitative evaluations and examine
how the speaker’s personality traits affect the synthesised
movements.

**Project details**  
Inspiration to study the quality of FFP2-masks is essential for providing appropriate protection against contagious diseases. What it does during the production process, we can contribute to improve the quality of FFP2-masks through experimental design and statistical modelling by considering specific characteristics of the masks (for example their water repellency). The main issue we face is that we need a producer of FFP2-masks available to perform the experimental runs and to provide us the experimental observations (data). Given data, we are able to do this in brief time. How we built it The statistical methodology we aim to apply is the key point able to: i) provide fast check of the quality of masks during the production process, and ii) assure the production of FFP2-masks with very good quality in order to provide appropriate protection against contagious diseases. Challenges we ran into establish the optimum or near to the optimum setting of the process factors for masks. Accomplishments that we're proud of The team is working since many years on quality of products and industrial processes ( Statistics for Engineering: Rossella Berni interviewed by Mariagela Delle Piane (Esaote SpA) - Florence (I) - June 4th, 2018: https://vimeo.com/275255002). We faced many issues in order to solve the quality of materials, electronic equipments and manufacturing industrial processes.

This dataset features the yearly amount of general goods on ferries flowing in and flowing out of Kiel Harbour in Germany. 

Kiel is located near the Kiel-Canal or Kiel Canal ""Nord-Ostsee-Kanal"" / ""North-Baltic Sea canal"" which is the world’s busiest man-made water-way navigable by seagoing ships. It is used by a similar number of ships as on the Panama and Suez Canals together. The canal links the North Sea to the Baltic Sea and provides a direct link for the North Sea ports to the Baltic Sea region. For the seaports of Hamburg, Bremen, Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven, in particular, the Kiel Canal is an indispensable transit route enabling them to operate efficiently. The time and distance ad-vantages (a saving of 460 km) offered by the Kiel Canal provide shipping with a competitive edge. 

The relevant costal countries here are all the states located at the Baltic Sea, namely Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Sweden.

This data could be used as an indicator for commercial activity in the region and/or to forecast future activity.

 A new 3D face database that includes a rich set of expressions,
systematic variation of poses and different types of occlusions is presented in
this paper. This database is unique from three aspects: i) the facial expressions
are composed of judiciously selected subset of Action Units as well as the six
basic emotions, and many actors/actresses are incorporated to obtain more
realistic expression data; ii) a rich set of head pose variations are available; and
iii) different types of face occlusions are included. Hence, this new database can
be a very valuable resource for development and evaluation of algorithms on
face recognition under adverse conditions and facial expression analysis as well
as for facial expression synthesis.

Explanation of BatPac:

The Battery Performance and Cost (BatPaC) model is a calculation method based on Microsoft® Office Excel spreadsheets that has been developed at Argonne for estimating the performance and manufacturing cost of lithium-ion batteries for electric-drive vehicles including hybrid-electrics (HEV), plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and pure electrics. The effort is being funded by the Vehicle Technology Office (VTO), which is part of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) office of the U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE). BatPaC was first developed in 2007, was subsequently peer reviewed, and it has served Argonne researchers and the greater battery community in studying the impact of material properties on performance at the pack level. With further developments the model now allows the design of cells and battery packs for automotive applications, to meet performance requirements (power, energy, recharge time), and estimates the cost of manufacturing the designed batteries. Since the cost depends on the materials, the design, and the manufacturing process, this bottom-up model/tool enables the user to study their effects. Designed for the lithium ion cell and battery researcher, BatPaC helps answer many ​“what-if” questions by being

Transparent in the assumptions made and the method of calculation
Capable of designing a battery specifically for the requirements of an application
Constrained by the physical limitations that govern battery performance
A bottom-up calculation approach to account for every cost factor

Copernicus is a European system for monitoring the Earth. Copernicus consists of a complex set of systems which collect data from multiple sources: earth observation satellites and in situ sensors such as ground stations, airborne and sea-borne sensors. It processes these data and provides users with reliable and up-to-date information through a set of services related to environmental and security issues. The services address six thematic areas: land monitoring, marine monitoring, atmosphere monitoring, climate change, emergency management and security. The main users of Copernicus services are policymakers and public authorities who need the information to develop environmental legislation and policies or to take critical decisions in the event of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or a humanitarian crisis. Based on the Copernicus services and on the data collected through the Sentinels and the contributing missions , many value-added services can be tailored to specific public or commercial needs, resulting in new business opportunities.

Sentiment data allows investors to analyze the market based on the tokens that are being discussed the most, the emotional state of the market, and whether sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative around each individual token. Such analysis, especially when combined with natural language processing and machine learning techniques, helps investors spot tokens that are trending or capitulating, identify entry and exit points, and understand which topics of discussion (e.g. DeFi, farming, staking) are hot in the market.

I am excited to be participating in this new Ocean Protocol data marketplace in the beta version. This is a simple test for educational purposes only. No LP will be withdrawn as I do not want to get in trouble(this is not a commercial venture, in fact it costs me $$$ to do this). All material contained in this vault is freely available online, and collected and curated by myself over time. The vault will be added to regularly if there seems to be interest in this test project. Any questions, comments, or suggestions are to be forwarded to goblinsandtrolls247@gmail.com

If you have any gifs you would like to contribute, please email whatever you would like to the listed email address as well(I will still be acting as curator). There is a 15 gig limit to the google drive, but if there is enough interest in a curated gif data base, I will keep working on it, and updating, dividing into folders, and expanding storage if need be(I would need interest and suggestions to warrant spending any real time on this aspect). The right is reserved to delete anything in the drive at any time, as well as to stop uploading to the drive. This is just a test, and I plan to follow through and see where it goes, but I also don't want to be married to a full time volunteer gif curating job for life either. 

The gif database contains 2.4 gigs of gifs at the time of this dataset being published.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  

This is V3, first version didn’t work, and V2 didn’t either. Took some workarounds for a couple days to figure it out. I am hoping it works this time. The reason for this test is that I wanted to create something that people might actually try to use, as opposed to simply providing liquidity, because for a proper beta test, we need to be using data, as well as pooling, etc, and pushing the boundaries for this beta test phase so the kinks get ironed out for when more functionality begins to come online.  

I will keep my promise and not pull out liquidity in original gif vault, until everyone else pulls theirs, so please pull your liquidity, so we can all get out value back for a failed test. WILL NOT PULL LIQUIDITY ON ORIGINAL GIF VAULT UNTIL I OWN 100% OF LP - (This goes for original GIF VAULT as well as V2). For this one(V3), if it does work(it should as I tested heavily in Rinkeby for almost 2 full days) I will not be pulling liquidity, ever, unless project kinda dies off, and again, I won’t pull LP until I own 100%(or damned near close to it, and I will give ample announcements if I do decide to shut it down). I’m hoping to have something up in the market that isn’t completely useless or easy to find in one place(like many data sets are just taken from elsewhere as is, without being processed, and freely available). Something people might want to actually use.

People like gif’s, right? So…. Have fun out there. Lets see where we can push the boundaries of Ocean Marketplace!!!!

  A final note(V2): I couldn’t link directly to a folder in the link uploaded for the data set(sample was just one gif as opposed to folder of gifs in test, and main database got scrambled by algorithm and pumped out wall of code). The work around I figured out is to make a pdf, upload that to a google drive, and the pdf contains a link and a password that goes to a password protected rerouter, through tiny url, and then onto the google drive database folder. If you want to know where to find the tool I used for your own solution, the password rerouter I used is here: 

https://jstrieb.github.io/link-lock/create/

I’m not a dev so please excuse my archaic methods to try and make this work.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  

Final test note(V3)…. Okay, first two versions, the links went to pdf’s on a google drive. The sample worked, but the main one didn’t. It gets chewed up in the algorithm and you end up with a wall of code. This third test will use excel spreadsheets for both( .xlsx extension ), made in google sheets, and stored on google drive. Hopefully this information might save someone from burning a couple hundred dollars in tx fees alone trying to get this thing to work like I did. Also, hopefully the .xlsx extension works for this…. If not…. honestly…. Ugh…. Lol.

You’ll find me near a brick wall smashing my thick goblin skull against it wondering why I am so stubborn when I’m doing something that feels above my head.  

If this last version doesn’t work, I will announce it, and try getting everyone to remove liquidity from all pools and I will bow out with a valiant effort, and an empty pocket(once I own 100% lp in each pool), and let the experts deal with it.

If it does work, V3 will stay up for the foreseeable future, and I will have no intention of taking it down or pulling LP…. If there is interest, I will continue to update and listen to suggestions. So please, if you like this idea, email the email listed in the first paragraph, and send in your gifs and suggestions, and lets make this a fun collective community effort!

## Largest Worldwide Collection relating IP Allocations to Geolocation (Including IANA reserved IPs)

This Database is operated and maintained by [**Global Network Discovery**](mailto:globalnetworkdiscovery@gmail.com) and __updated every 24 hours__. It represents most of the IPV4 numbers in use on the Internet today and includes the IANA reserved IPs. 

**Aggregated to include IPV4 allocations in all countries.** 

**This Database is automatically reconstructed every 24 hours.**

## Purpose
Numerical ranges of IPV4 address allocations linked to country code enables for more effective and efficient implementation in various fields of research.

 Some potential use cases include:
1.  Metanalysis of trend-data in conjunction with regional IP ranges
2.  Metanalysis of public health information with reference to location
3.  On-line Advertising campaigns including targeted banners 
4.  Location Aware Content Creation from real-time geolocation 
5.  Forensic investigations of fraud detection
6.  Assessing and filtering web traffic from various regions of the world
7.  Email services for identifying the country of the sender

**End-use cases have unlimited potential as data can provide exposure to relationships otherwise unnoticed**
#

## IPV4 Collection Metadata

**IP FROM (int)**
> Numerical representation of IP address (Start of allocation range)
>> *Example:*
 
>> 1.2.3.4 
>> = 4 + (3 * 256) + (2 * 256^2) + (1 * 256^3)
>>         = 16909060

**IP TO (int)**
> Numerical representation of IP address (End of allocation range)

**REGISTRY (str)**
> apnic, arin, lacnic, ripencc and afrinic
> *Note:* Also includes IANA IETF Reserved Address Numbers (useful for spoof detection)

**ASSIGNED (int)**
> The date this IP or block was assigned. (In Epoch seconds)
> *Note:* Where the allocation or assignment has been transferred from one registry to another, the date represents the date of first assignment or allocation as received in from the original RIR. It is noted that where records do not show a date of first assignment, the date is given as ""0"".

**CID (str)**
> 2 character international country code
> *NOTE:* ISO 3166 2-letter code of the organization to which the allocation or assignment was made

**CAB (str)**
> Country abbreviation; Usually a 3 character representation.

**CNTRY (str)**
> Full country name

- Payment merchants like Visa, Mastercard or American Express possess valuable consumer insights to spending behavior co-relating to socio-economic backgrounds and other demographics.

- *The value-proposal*
- The datasets may provide access for individuals and companies that are looking to potentially gain market intelligence to further optimize their promotional strategies, as well as possibly deploying machine learning algorithms to analyse the electronic payment eco-system. 

- *Dataset: Credit card transactions*

Nearly 10,000 customer profiles in Europe organized by customer ID (non-sensitive) that was gathered over the course of a defined period and may be updated regularly.

They talked industry and craft, and over many meetings, they formed a theory on staying famous.
The key, they said, was pacing yourself. Comedians had to do occasional appearances in the media, but not too many. Otherwise, they ran the risk of running through all their material... burning out their audiences... and never getting an invitation to a TV show again.

International Polar Year (IPY), focusing on the north and south polar regions, aimed to investigate the impact of how changes to the ice sheets affect ocean and climate change to the habitats in these regions. To meet the project goal, world space agencies observed these regions intensively using their own Earth observation satellites.

One of these satellites, ALOS - with the PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensor - observed these regions independently from day-night conditions or weather conditions. >

Carrying on this initiative, ESA is providing the ALOS PALSAR IPY Antarctica dataset, which consists of full resolution ALOS PALSAR ScanSAR WB1 products (Level L1.5, 100m spatial resolution, 250-350Km swath). The extension of this dataset by more recent acquisitions over Antarctica is currently on going.

Sentiment data allows investors to analyze the market based on the tokens that are being discussed the most, the emotional state of the market, and whether sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative around each individual token.  Such analysis, especially when combined with natural language processing and machine learning techniques, helps investors spot tokens that are trending or capitulating, identify entry and exit points, and understand which topics of discussion (e.g. DeFi, farming, staking) are hot in the market.

This PROPRIETARY dataset consists of sentiment analysis for altcoins based on scraping all recent Twitter mentions of $OCEAN (over 10000 tweets) and $ETH/$Ethereum (over 10000 tweets).

This dataset expands the view on cargo loaded and unloaded in Kiel Harbour, Germany, as provided in https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:7DDE3aa7B1A29EB8b4c6D7b37f4B5A3e0cCAD3d4 by providing the actual data on passengers and verhicles shipped through Kiel Harbour, Germany.

It also relates to the dataset on traffic in the Kiel-Canal, as provided in https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:1337E73Ef8Ec1cd92d2C67B272D14223a43ffF46

This dataset features the annual amounts of passengers and vehicle categories going through Kiel Harbour. Kiel Harbour is located next to the Kiel-Canal or ""Nord-Ostsee-Kanal"" which is the world’s busiest man-made water-way navigable by seagoing ships. It is used by a similar number of ships as on the Panama and Suez Canals together. The canal links the North Sea to the Baltic Sea and pro-vides a direct link for the North Sea ports to the Baltic Sea region. For the seaports of Hamburg, Bremen, Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven, in particular, the Kiel Canal is an indispensable transit route enabling them to operate efficiently. The time and distance ad-vantages (a saving of 460 km) offered by the Kiel Canal provide shipping with a competitive edge. 

The relevant costal countries here are all the states located at the Baltic Sea, namely Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Sweden.

This data could be used as an indicator for commercial and tourism activity in the region and/or to forecast future activity.

Value has been added by translation, aggregation of various datasets and by providing metadata for the datamarket.

The data is provided under Data licence Germany - Zero - Version 2.0.

Context
The datasets provided include the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 21 (""players_21.csv""). The data allows multiple comparison of the same players across the last 7 version of the videogame.

Some ideas of possible analysis:

-Historical comparison between Messi and Ronaldo (what skill attributes changed the most during time compared to reallife stats);
-Make your dream team;
-Analyse which Club or National Team has the best-rated players;
-Assess the strength of a team at a particular position;
-Analyse the team with the best dribbling speed;
-Co-relate between Age and Overall rating;
-Co-relate between Age and Nationality;
-Co-relate between Age and Potential;
-Could prove of immense value to Fantasy Premier League enthusiasts.

These are just basic examples, sky is the limit.

Ideal budget to create a competitive team (at the level of top n teams in Europe) and at which point the budget does not allow to buy significantly better players for the 11-men lineup. An extra is the same comparison with the Potential attribute for the lineup instead of the Overall attribute;

Sample analysis of top n% players (e.g. top 5% of the player) to see if some important attributes as Agility or BallControl or Strength have been popular or not acroos the FIFA versions. An example would be seeing that the top 5% players of FIFA 21 are more fast (higher Acceleration and Agility) compared to FIFA 15. The trend of attributes is also an important indication of how some attributes are necessary for players to win games (a version with more top 5% players with high BallControl stats would indicate that the game is more focused on the technique rather than the physicial aspect).

They build them, are famous for them and deeply love them. Lets analyze the preferences of German individuals and companies when it comes to automobiles, trucks and trailers (utility vehicles) in detail.

This dataset of more than 660.000 data points contains detailed aggregated registration information for the German market for more than 47 million automobiles and more than 5.5 million utility vehicles from over 100 different manufactures over the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. It features data for each individual combination of manufacturer / brand, trading name of the individual vehicles, type key number, power, fuel type, type of vehicle body, overall number of registered vehicles of this type, number of registrations for private individuals, number of vehicle owners aged 29 or less, vehicle owners aged 60 or more and the number of number of female owners.

This dataset is highly valuable to keep track of the market, predict changing customer preferences, target audiences for campaigns and market shares based on changing distributions of registrations over time. 

Data is provided as CSV file to allow machine readability and a sample is provided to validate content and structure of data for further usage. The full dataset contains about 4 MB of data to compute and analyze.

## Disclaimer and a few words on the current state of the (beta) market:

1. Some argue that this information is obtainable through other sources and might not be unique, but this is not what this is all about. This market is about added value, access to valuable data, the pricing of valuable information and market exploration in ways that where not possible before. You might spend a lot of time and money to acquire and prepare this information yourself, if you are capable of doing it. This data has been found, prepared, translated and aggregated to add as much value as possible and to drive new applications. 

2. Stake responsibly and be aware that you are setting the price for the asset through the dynamic pricing mechanism. If you want to speculate on this asset, you might chose to do so on your own risk and after doing your own research. Be aware that this might negatively affect the chance of someone buying this asset by driving prices too high. Part of this  minimizes potential revenue of sales and thus staking rewards based on sales. Preparing this data is work and I will of course take partial profits from the dataset to cover for work, gas fees and cover risks involved in this highly volatile beta market. Thanks for your patience and understanding.

3. I only provide valuable information with added value without copyright infringements or violations of property rights. If you like my work and want to support it, you can find my community reputation profile here:

trend known as Big Data Computing; a new paradigm which combines large scale compute, new data intensive techniques
and mathematical models to build data analytics. Big Data computing demands a huge storage and computing for data
curation and processing that could be delivered from on-premise or clouds infrastructures. This paper discusses the
evolution of Big Data computing, differences between traditional data warehousing and Big Data, taxonomy of Big Data
computing and underpinning technologies, integrated platform of Big Data and Clouds known as Big Data Clouds, layered
architecture and components of Big Data Cloud and finally discusses open technical challenges and future directions.

We used Couette flow as a model for the stable boundary layer. The flow evolution is investigated for combinations of the (bulk) Reynolds number and the imposed surface buoyancy flux. First, we establish what the similarities and differences are between applying a fixed buoyancy difference (Dirichlet) and a fixed buoyancy flux (Neumann) as boundary conditions. Moreover, two distinct parameters were recently proposed for the turbulent-to-laminar transition: the Reynolds number based on the Obukhov length and the ‘‘shear capacity,’’ a velocity-scale ratio based on the buoyancy flux maximum. We study how these parameters relate to each other and to the atmospheric boundary layer.
We recorded 87 statistical quantities (mentioned in sample file) in multiple runs. 

These data have been obtained using the MicroHH solver for computational fluid dynamics.

The air emission accounts describe the emissions of air pollutants and gases as a result of Dutch economic activities. This is including the emissions of residents abroad and excluding emissions of non-residents in the Netherlands. The emissions of the substances are allocated to the various economic activities. Emissions from natural sources are excluded as these emissions are not related to economic activities. In this table, the emission of pollutants and gases from stationary sources (such as power plants) as well as mobile sources (such as road transport) are allocated to the different industries or households. Included are CO (carbon monoxide); CO2 (carbon dioxide); CH4 (methane); 
N2O (nitrous oxide also known as laughing gas); NOx (nitrogen oxides (diversity)); SO2 (sulphur dioxide); NH3 (ammonia); PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres); NMVOC (volatile organic compounds excluding methane (CH4)).

Datapoints have been gathered among electric vehicle enthusiasts over a 3-year span via survey and will be updated every quarter.

Important notices:

Data hasn’t been verified as it’s gathered via surveys among users, but obviously incorrect statistics have been cleaned out.

Users were asked battery percentage after 50.000 kilometers, 100.000 kilometers, 150.000 kilometers, and 200.000 kilometers. 

Due to the short time frame most of the inputs now over 150.000 is from professional drivers (taxi etc.) It will also get better over time.

Use cases:

There aren’t a big amount of studies/data about battery degradation over EV’s available in public. Car manufacturers like to keep these themselves and usually, it’s about one particular manufacturer. This set has different manufacturers and models included so it’s easier to get the bigger picture.

Upcoming improvements:

Also gathering manufacturer, model, year, type of charger used, lowest usage temperature, highest usage temperature, and report if the battery pack has been serviced or changed due to failure. Now only including an excel sheet of data points, but we will be illustrating data points similar to Steinbuch’s.

Disclaimer from electric vehicle enthusiast himself. Do your research about electric vehicles and consider it for your next daily driver. You have been told these scary stories about how the battery pack lasts only two years before failure. That’s not true. Take your time and read for example this Maarten Steinbuch’s (Eindhoven University of Technology) info about degradation.

The sample data picture is just an example of how the data will be provided in Dropbox. For now, it contains an excel of 5300 individual inputs and a Google slide for better general understanding.

The inaugural ‘Central America: Integration, investment and trade opportunities’ report, produced by OMFIF jointly with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, shows that:
 

New country partners, such as South Korea, are increasing their attention on Central America with various infrastructure projects underway.
Central America was the only bloc in Latin America and the Caribbean to experience year-on-year export growth in the first quarter of 2020. 
The European Union is the region’s most important development partner, contributing 50.3% of total funding for development projects since 2014.
Central America’s banking system entered the Covid-19 crisis in a strong position, with financial soundness indicators outperforming minimum international benchmarks.
Green transport and energy infrastructure lead sustainable investment opportunities in the region, such as the development of an electric train in Costa Rica.

The report aims to highlight the region’s potential by identifying growth opportunities and evaluating countries based on quantitative and qualitative indicators that are important to foreign investors.

Despite global economic and social challenges, Central America is forecast to have one of the strongest rebounds in Latin America and the Caribbean, supported by the agility and responsiveness of individual economies in coping with the pandemic’s disruptions.

The report covers eight countries: Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama. It presents a wide-ranging view of the region through five pillars: a macroeconomic overview; commerce, external trade and foreign direct investment; integration; finance, tax and transparency; and sustainable investment.

‘This is the first of a series of reports that will share key insights on the region,’ said Dante Mossi, executive president of CABEI. ‘The report is meant to be a tool for anyone who is interested in doing business in Central America.’

Countries’ unified efforts on economic and social integration, institutional strengthening, sustainability and security will be crucial to the region’s ability to overcome this crisis. This work will be essential to chart a sustainable path to long-term growth.

‘Our research highlights that there are significant elements of resilience for Central American economies in the face of the present crisis,' said OMFIF's chief economist, Danae Kyriakopoulou. 'Despite vulnerabilities to external risks stemming from the pandemic and climate change, the macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, and there is important growth potential particularly when it comes to sustainable investment opportunities in infrastructure.’", central-america latinn-america markets investments,1065662,image/png,https://i.imgur.com/QaqYYJH.png,True,0x04f6b378508864be18739b44a5b90cbf598b518e69840a4dd3556336e5d3aa42c018f31061fb72e42e2c99f7ebf34d92b6719455579e3a440ad44ce129a9c53ad68d2b65d686b91282f3b283ecb88a0e425ec94e53e00fd0afe28aa5058899b0745ed58ed00d9f77a8c4102a6f717a65c9bea60d9c32eda49c1dbb0879e2416e895dbe842e71a940624e094867dba719ff0a67768b037bf4c7c9065da8eae3fab4fa1dd7472ddd,0,0xE1c051397Ef1cfE2e4989712E300D6348c8c7096,2020-10-29T13:24:40Z,2020-10-29T13:24:40Z,0x7420fA58bA44E1141d5E9ADB6903BE549f7cE0b5,AddressHash,0xec58f9e107f1912178db57127ff6ac346af0b747e26594e0d8759029f168cc82,0xE1c051397Ef1cfE2e4989712E300D6348c8c7096,Brave Shrimp Token,BRASHR-34,18,9.0,1000.0,0x7420fA58bA44E1141d5E9ADB6903BE549f7cE0b5,0.0,2020-10-29T13:24:40Z,9.0,44.00633605997549,85.58586233577512,pool,0x429474feece1D3198b60384b66EeB2A8438B538A,0x429474feece1D3198b60384b66EeB2A8438B538A, 0x429474feece1D3198b60384b66EeB2A8438B538A

About:

The objective of this project is to analyse the relation between the Bitcoin price and S&P 500 index.


The market capitalization of cryptocurrency has exploded since 2015, reaching over $800 billion by January of 2018, and settling at over $200 billion by 3Q 2018 (from less than $20 billion in early 2017).

Among the top of the foodchain in this industry are crypto funds which speculate on currency prices and new blockchain related startups (AKA Initial coin offerings).

Add tokens to this liquidity pool to add trust to a Data Publisher. 

This could be used for:

-Promoting community trust in a Data Publishers Ethereum Address

-Donating tokens to the Publisher for future content creation (covering gas fees, Gofundme ventures, etc.)

-Publisher can Airdrop tokens to people that interact with the Pool

More! Whatever you can think of, this is my proposal for a solution to the trouble with scams/rugpulls/imposters. Add liquidity if you like it! Duh!

Attention: I WILL liquidate tokens occasionally in small increments to fund any future Data Publishings! But I will PROMISE not to Rugpull!

Feel free to copy my idea :) Since I am the first one, I encourage you to improve upon the idea with yours and customize it for YOU! Create a profile etc...!

Here is one of my first things I published to verify my address further. I also go by the name PrismatiK because I've used that name in Rarible! I've also uploaded an image of my editable telegram handle in the sample & in the file download I uploaded a Trent NFT I created ;) So the this token is technically also a Trent NFT!

Thanks to the vast degree of digital transformation and the Internet of Things, unprecedented amounts of data can be captured from various supply chain sources. Capitalizing on its value offers massive potential to increase operational efficiency, improve customer experience, reduce risk, and create new business models.

Key Developments & Implications
Since its arrival in the first edition of the DHL Logistics Trend Radar in 2013, Big Data Analytics has developed and today is increasingly becoming part of the de-facto operating model for the logistics industry. Surging demand for personalized and context-based services has driven development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning applications which, in turn, have upped the need for larger datasets in the industry for better results.

Additionally, the rapid migration of enterprise data storage from traditional datacenters to the cloud has provided more flexibility in effectively scaling storage and processing power for all collected data. The need for visibility and prediction is ever-more pressing. COVID-19 has caused unprecedented uncertainty in supply chains globally, affecting how goods are moved and altering consumer demand and behavior.

Big data analytics holds the key to uncovering hidden issues across entire supply chains and surfacing trends that are not so obvious. As companies around the world recover, demand is growing for promising features of data analytics, such as mitigating disaster risks, simulating operations, and improving customer service.

Sentiment data allows investors to analyze the market based on the tokens that are being discussed the most, the emotional state of the market, and whether sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative around each individual token.  Such analysis, especially when combined with natural language processing and machine learning techniques, helps investors spot tokens that are trending or capitulating, identify entry and exit points, and understand which topics of discussion (e.g. DeFi, farming, staking) are hot in the market.

""This issue of MIT Technology Review is
meant as an antidote. It looks at things that
may happen in the years, decades, centuries,
and even millennia hence, and what needs
to change now to make the future better
than it looks from this precarious moment.
As the image on our cover is meant to
suggest, these changes aren’t the kinds
of Band-Aid solutions the world has been
applying for the past few years—a carbon
tax here, a health-care expansion there,
a financial regulation reform over there.
Some of them will involve questioning
long-held assumptions.
For example, as David Rotman writes
on page 14, the economic doctrine of
high GDP growth, once challenged only
by people on the radical fringe, is now
being questioned by Nobel-winning economists. As James Temple outlines (page 40),
California needs to scrap century-old fire
management policies to fight its wildfires.
And the field of AI is just coming to grips
with the very real threats the technology
can pose, as a leading researcher tells Karen Hao (page 38).
One of the biggest challenges we face is a meta-problem that
makes all the others harder to tackle: the breakdown of shared
systems of understanding. Matthew Hutson (page 74) uses the
LIGO gravitational-wave detector to show just how much of what
we know is contingent on trusting other humans’ knowledge,
and what happens if this “epistemic dependence” is undermined.
And Abby Ohlheiser (page 30) writes about the scholars and
activists, overwhelmingly women and people of color, whose
warnings about the attacks on truth through online abuse and
conspiracy movements were ignored for years""

The SEDD contain the universe of discharge information on all patients in participating States who were seen in a hospital-affiliated emergency department without being admitted to the hospital (patients admitted to the hospital are captured in the HCUP State Inpatient Databases, described elsewhere in this compendium). The SEDD standardizes data fields across States, thereby facilitating across- and between-State analyses.  Data collected by the SEDD include patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, insurance and billing information, and more.  The SEDD can be linked to the American Hospital Association Annual Survey File and the Area Resource File, except in those States that do not allow the release of hospital identifiers (these other databases are described elsewhere in this compendium).  Data can be accessed after completion of a Data Use Agreement, online training, and application kit.  The SEDD range in price from $35 to more than $3000 per State per year, depending on the State.

Major foci 

The State Emergency Department Databases include data in the following areas.  The completeness and composition of data files varies between States.

I am excited to be participating in this new Ocean Protocol data marketplace in the beta version. This is a simple test for educational purposes only. No LP will be withdrawn as I do not want to get in trouble(this is not a commercial venture, in fact it costs me $$$ to do this). All material contained in this vault is freely available online, and collected and curated by myself over time. The vault will be added to regularly if there seems to be interest in this test project. Any questions, comments, or suggestions are to be forwarded to goblinsandtrolls247@gmail.com

If you have any gifs you would like to contribute, please email whatever you would like to the listed email address as well(I will still be acting as curator). There is a 15 gig limit to the google drive, but if there is enough interest in a curated gif data base, I will keep working on it, and updating, dividing into folders, and expanding storage if need be(I would need interest and suggestions to warrant spending any real time on this aspect). The right is reserved to delete anything in the drive at any time, as well as to stop uploading to the drive. This is just a test, and I plan to follow through and see where it goes, but I also don't want to be married to a full time volunteer gif curating job for life either.

The SEDD contain the universe of discharge information on all patients in participating States who were seen in a hospital-affiliated emergency department without being admitted to the hospital (patients admitted to the hospital are captured in the HCUP State Inpatient Databases, described elsewhere in this compendium). The SEDD standardizes data fields across States, thereby facilitating across- and between-State analyses.  Data collected by the SEDD include patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, insurance and billing information, and more.  The SEDD can be linked to the American Hospital Association Annual Survey File and the Area Resource File, except in those States that do not allow the release of hospital identifiers (these other databases are described elsewhere in this compendium).  Data can be accessed after completion of a Data Use Agreement, online training, and application kit.  The SEDD range in price from $35 to more than $3000 per State per year, depending on the State.

Major foci 

The State Emergency Department Databases include data in the following areas.  The completeness and composition of data files varies between States.

How fast do these businesses recover from the effects of Covid-19 during and after a Covid-19 wave? These effects can be analyzed by this dataset or AI and algorithms can be trained to forcast the effects based on this data and current infection rates.  

This dataset provides data from January 2019 to July 2020 on new infections with Covid-19 Coronavirus and relevant tourism data for the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein in Northern Germany on lower district level and overall level.

This dataset is a compilation of 20 different datasets. These datasets have been used to construct a time series from January 2019 to July 2020.

It is planned to curate this dataset further to add more history to it and to add future available timesets for the 2nd Covid-19 infection wave to further help analysis and AI training to forecast the economic effects.

It is worth mentioning that Schleswig-Holstein is a federal states with a very high economic activity in this sector as it lies next to the Baltic Sea and maintained low infection rates after the first wave for some time to allow recovery of economic activity and hospitality quickly. This is a special case, even in Germany, and might give hints how to limit the devastating economic effect of Covid-19 spread and allow a faster recovery afterwards.

Our monitors show what the climate conditions are like inside the trailers. We use blockchain technology to store and share that information securely with truck drivers and other users along the supply chain. Everything from temperature to humidity can be monitored.

Dataset contains precision analysis made from 08/01/2020 to 10/01/2020.

**Our sensor tracked the following conditions:**

**Temperature & Humidity**  
We have created our own bespoke Temperature & Humidity sensor that is robust enough to survive the rigours of transportation. These sensors have an expected battery life of over 1 year and come in a tamper-proof ruggedized container.

**Carbon dioxide and Ammonia**  
We have created our own Carbon dioxide and Ammonia sensor. This is important because high levels of Carbon dioxide and Ammonia could be a precursor to possible catastrophic events occuring while animals are in transport. These sensors have an expected battery life of over 1 year and comes in a tamper-proof ruggedized container.


**Vibration**  
We have created our own bespoke vibration sensor to understand the effects of vibration of livestock animals as they are being transported. These sensors have an expected battery life of over 1 year and comes in a tamper-proof ruggedized container.

**Surface Temperature**  
Our surface temperature sensor has been specifically designed to ensure that the livestock trailer has met certain Biosecurty protocols. Its designed to validate thermo-assisted drying and decontamination (TADD) protocols and making sure that every part of your trailer has met these protocols. We are world leaders in the development of these surface temperatures in the application of disease monitoring on livestock trailers.
